# NYC Airbnb Dataset Analysis and AB Testing Project

## Overview

This project aims to analyze the 2019 NYC Airbnb dataset, conduct data cleaning and manipulation, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), and conduct an AB test to determine if there is a significant difference in the distribution of prices between listings in Manhattan and Brooklyn. The analysis is conducted using Python and various libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scipy, and Statsmodels. Additionally, the project involves the creation of machine learning models to classify hosts based on their booking popularity.

## Project Objectives

1. **Data Cleaning and Manipulation:** Clean up the dataset for proper use with analysis and machine learning.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Conduct EDA to gain insights into the dataset and visualize the relationships between various attributes.
3. **AB Testing:** Perform an AB test to determine if there is a significant difference in the distribution of prices between listings in Manhattan and Brooklyn.
4. **Machine Learning:** Create a classification model to categorize hosts into different tiers based on their booking popularity.

## Dataset Description

The dataset consists of various attributes related to Airbnb listings in NYC, including listing details, host information, location coordinates, pricing, availability, and reviews.

## Project Progress

1. **Data Cleaning and Manipulation:** Completed data cleaning and handling of null values in relevant columns. Unrealistic price listings and listings with no availability were filtered out.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Conducted initial EDA to visualize the distribution of quantitative variables and understand relationships between attributes.
3. **AB Testing:** Performed an AB test to compare the distribution of prices between listings in Manhattan and Brooklyn. The test results showed a significant difference, with listings in Manhattan having a higher average price than those in Brooklyn.

## Next Steps

1. Develop machine learning models to classify hosts into different tiers based on their booking popularity.
2. Implement SQL database creation with triggers, transactions, and stored procedures.
3. Generate visualizations using Tableau for in-depth data exploration.
4. Create Streamlit web apps to showcase findings and insights from the data.

## Conclusion

The project aims to provide valuable insights into the NYC Airbnb dataset, including factors influencing pricing and booking popularity. By leveraging data analysis, machine learning, SQL databases, and visualization tools, the project aims to deliver actionable insights for Airbnb hosts and stakeholders.
