# NYC Airbnb Dataset Analysis and AB Testing Project

## Overview
This project aims to analyze the 2019 NYC Airbnb dataset, conduct data cleaning and manipulation, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), and conduct an AB test to determine whether hosts with reviews over a certain threshold garner more bookings. The analysis is conducted using Python and various libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scipy, and Statsmodels. Additionally, the project involves the creation of a SQL database to store the cleaned and adjusted data, with triggers, transactions, and stored procedures implemented. Visualizations are also generated using Tableau, and findings from the data visualizations are showcased on Streamlit web apps.

## Project Objectives
1. **Data Cleaning and Manipulation:** Clean up the dataset for proper use with analysis and machine learning.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Conduct EDA to gain insights into the dataset and visualize the relationships between various attributes.

3. **AB Testing:** Determine whether hosts with reviews over a certain threshold receive more bookings compared to those with fewer reviews through AB testing.

4. **Machine Learning:** Create a regression or classification model to predict booking popularity or classify hosts/listings into tiers based on bookings.

5. **SQL Database:** Create a SQL database to store the cleaned and adjusted data, with triggers, transactions, and stored procedures implemented.

6. **Visualizations with Tableau:** Generate visualizations using Tableau for easy and intuitive data exploration.

7. **Streamlit Web Apps:** Showcase findings from the data visualizations on Streamlit web apps for interactive exploration.

## Dataset Description
The dataset consists of various attributes related to Airbnb listings in NYC, including listing details, host information, location coordinates, pricing, availability, and reviews.

## Project Progress
1. **Data Cleaning and Manipulation:** Completed data cleaning and handling of null values in relevant columns. Unrealistic price listings and listings with no availability were filtered out.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Conducted initial EDA to visualize the distribution of quantitative variables and understand relationships between attributes.

3. **AB Testing:** Prepared for AB testing to compare the number of reviews for lower-priced listings (between $50 and $150) versus higher-priced listings (between $150 and $300).

## Next Steps
1. Complete the AB testing process to determine the impact of reviews on booking popularity.
2. Develop machine learning models to predict booking popularity or classify hosts/listings.
3. Implement SQL database creation with triggers, transactions, and stored procedures.
4. Generate visualizations using Tableau for in-depth data exploration.
5. Create Streamlit web apps to showcase findings and insights from the data.

## Conclusion
The project aims to provide valuable insights into the NYC Airbnb dataset, including factors influencing booking popularity and host performance. By leveraging data analysis, machine learning, SQL databases, and visualization tools, the project aims to deliver actionable insights for Airbnb hosts and stakeholders.
